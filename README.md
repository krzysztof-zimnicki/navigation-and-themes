# Navigation and Themes
This is my learning project -- a very simple top navigation and theme-changer component build with React and NextJS. 
You can directly preview the app here: https://navigation-and-themes.vercel.app/.

## Quick Start

You can get started by cloning this repository and running 'npm install' in the directory, then ''npm run dev'' to run it on localhost. If you want to use the component outside of the provided page.tsx you can do  so by importing 'Navigation' from components
